# 🏛 Governance — Bhinneka ($BHEK)

This document describes the governance model for the Bhinneka ($BHEK) project.

---

## 👑 Project Leadership

- The project is currently maintained by **Endi Hariadi (Founder & Maintainer)**.  
- As the primary maintainer, Endi has the authority to:
  - Review and merge Pull Requests  
  - Approve or reject proposals (features, changes, or policies)  
  - Manage releases and security patches  
  - Moderate community discussions in line with the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)  

---

## 🌱 Community Contributions

We welcome contributions from the community!  
Please see our [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for workflow and expectations.

Contributions may include:
- Code (features, bug fixes, optimizations)  
- Documentation (guides, translations, improvements)  
- Community support (moderation, outreach, events)  

---

## 🗳 Decision Making

Decisions are made transparently and documented in GitHub (issues, pull requests, or discussions).  
- **Small changes**: decided by maintainers during PR reviews.  
- **Major changes** (breaking changes, governance rules, tokenomics, licensing):  
  - Proposed via a GitHub Discussion or RFC issue  
  - Feedback gathered from the community  
  - Final decision made by the maintainer  

In the future, we may adopt **community voting** for certain decisions (e.g. roadmap priorities).

---

## 🔒 Security and Sensitive Decisions

- Security-related decisions follow the [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md).  
- Sensitive matters (e.g., token smart contracts, treasury, listings) will be decided privately by the maintainer, with public disclosure after resolutions.  

---

## 🤝 Community Roles (Future Plan)

As the project grows, we may introduce additional roles:
- **Core Maintainers** — trusted long-term contributors with merge rights  
- **Reviewers** — contributors who help triage issues and review PRs  
- **Community Moderators** — manage Telegram/Discord spaces in line with our Code of Conduct  

---

## 📢 Transparency

- All decisions and discussions are logged in GitHub issues or discussions when possible.  
- Release notes will summarize major changes.  
- Financial aspects (if any, e.g. treasury for $BHEK) will be shared transparently with the community.
